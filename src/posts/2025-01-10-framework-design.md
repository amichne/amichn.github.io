After building internal frameworks for the past few years, some principles keep emerging:

**Make the simple case trivial, the complex case possible.** Don't sacrifice ergonomics for edge cases, but provide escape hatches.

**Convention over configuration, with explicit overrides.** Sensible defaults that work 80% of the time, clear overrides for the other 20%.

**Fail loudly at initialization, not at runtime.** Configuration errors should blow up during startup, not three days into production.

**Observability is not optional.** Bake metrics, tracing, and structured logging into the framework core.

The hardest part isn't the initial design - it's maintaining coherence as requirements evolve while keeping the core simple.
