## Engineering

Backend software engineer focused on distributed systems challenges that most engineers never encounter: framework design at scale, cross-region data consistency, and the architectural patterns that enable teams to move quickly without breaking production.

Current focus areas:
- Distributed transaction patterns
- Multi-region data integrity
- Developer platform design
- Database internals

## Photography

I photograph empty spaces - urban landscapes devoid of people, natural landscapes that emphasize form over drama. The aesthetic is deliberate: clean compositions, minimal post-processing, focus on geometry and light.

Primary subjects:
- Empty city streets at dawn
- Mountain ridgelines
- Architectural repetition
- Natural minimalism
